Description: Package `{experienceAnalysis}` contains a suite of functions for performing 
  _text mining_ such as sentiment analysis, analysis of word counts, TF-IDFs and 
  _n_-grams etc. The package was  developed as a helper package for use with other 
  packages/repos developed by
  the [CDU Data Science Team](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team), but the 
  functions are generic and thus suitable for broader use. The largest focus is 
  on calculating sentiment indicators and word counts/frequencies for labeled or unlabeled text,
  and plotting the outcomes to easily detect potentially important information in
  the text. However, there are a few "spin-off" functions for assessing the 
  performance of a classification model, e.g. calculating accuracy per class, making
  and plotting confusion matrices etc.\n
  The package makes extensive use of [{tidytext}](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) 
  (Silge & Robinson, 2017) but also employs `Python` libraries for sentiment 
  analysis (e.g. [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)) with the use 
  of [{reticulate}](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).
