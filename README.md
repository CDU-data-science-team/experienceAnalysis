# experienceAnalysis

Package `{experienceAnalysis}` contains a suite of functions for performing 
_text mining_ such as sentiment analysis, analysis of word counts, TF-IDFs and 
_n_-grams etc. The package was  developed as a helper package for use with other 
packages/repos developed by
the [CDU Data Science Team](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team), but the 
functions are generic and thus suitable for broader use. The focus is 
on calculating sentiment indicators and word counts/frequencies for labeled or 
unlabeled text, and plotting the outcomes to easily detect potentially important information in the text. However, there are a few "spin-off" functions for 
assessing the performance of a classification model, e.g. calculating accuracy 
per class, making and plotting confusion matrices etc.

The **function documentation** is [here](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/experienceAnalysis/).

For an example of how the package is used in practice, see the 
[source code](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/pxtextminingdashboard) 
for [this  dashboard](https://involve.nottshc.nhs.uk:8443/text_mining_dashboard/).

The package makes extensive use of [{tidytext}](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) 
(Silge & Robinson, 2017).

In line with the broader work of the CDU Data Science Team, all function names
have prefixes that give users a hint of what type of operations they perform 
(e.g. `prep_*` and `plot_*` for preparing and plotting data respectively). 
See [Naming guidelines for functions](#naming-guidelines-for-functions).

## Naming guidelines for functions

### Data manipulations

-   `get_*()`: Get data, e.g. from a database or a file;
-   `tidy_*()`: Tidy data, e.g. renaming
    variables, removing duplicates, creating factors, "wide" to "long"
    format etc.;
-   `collect_*()`: Collect data of specific cases, mainly wrapper
    functions for specific filter commands;
-   `prep_*()`: Prepare data for further use, e.g. to create tables,
    sorting vectors etc.;

### Data analyses

-   `calc_*()`: Calculations or analyses, e.g. counting data, regression
    analyses etc.;
-   `summary_*()`: Summarise results of calculations (there might be
    some overlap with `prep_*()`);

### Visualisations

-   `plot_*()`: Create a plot;

## Deployment on a server

Note that the sentiment dictionaries loaded from `{tidytext}` (via 
[`{textdata}`]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textdata)) do not all have an 
open licence and users must accept the licence agreement the first time they run 
these functions. The console prompt to do this is not accessible when deploying 
this software on a server. Consequently, in order to deploy this application it 
is necessary to run the contents of the `data-raw/` folder. You will need to 
accept the terms of the licences yourself. When this is done, the data will be 
accessible to the package in `data/` and all of the sentiment dictionary 
functions will automatically load from this location instead of using the 
`{tidytext}` functions.
